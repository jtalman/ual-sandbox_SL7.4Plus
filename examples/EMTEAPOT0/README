This assumes a fresh "clone" of this code:
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus
      cd $UAL
      make clean
      make

This file is in
      $UAL/examples/EMTEAPOT0

A good way to initiate/start proceedings from here is the basic
      make clean
      make

This should pop up plots of some standard particles and overview the major files involved.

Specific input probes, and bunches of them, can now/then be templated.
