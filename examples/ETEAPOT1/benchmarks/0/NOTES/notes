This is intended to be a functionally equivalent port of (Google Codes) UAL::745. The source is/was one of Richard Talman's laptops.

The usage is straightforward: "near scripts" runExample_Figure_3, ... can be be copied and executed (via pasting).

These reproduce closely, if not exactly, Figures 2, 3, 4 in

File
     https://github.com/jtalman/ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus/blob/master/examples/ETEAPOT/statusAndRegression/benchmark.pdf
is also relevant. These documents are here.

Files
      Makefile
and
      tracker.cc
are most central. Their "diff" files are here.

I should probably "reconcile" files
      algorithm.hh
      algorithm.icc
      DipoleTracker.cc
      DipoleTracker.hh
with the "GIT top of the tree" or something along those lines. Their "diff" files are here.

I should also probably reconcile files
      designBeamValues.hh
      extractParameters.h
      getDesignBeam.h
      getTimeAlternate.inline
      probeDataForTwiss
      reference.inline
      setBeamAttributes.hh
      simulatedProbeValues
      verboseBlock.h

I have a notion that UAL::745 is "pre RF" (forward). Really just transverse. "lateral/out, and up".
