This assumes a fresh "clone" of this code:
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus
      cd ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus
      setenv UAL `pwd`
      source setup-linux-ual
      make clean
      make

This file is in
      $UAL/examples/EMTEAPOT0

A good way to initiate/start proceedings from here is the basic
      make clean
      make

This should pop up plots of some standard particles: the "X Standard Bunch". The One Turn (From Origin) Twiss Functions are also displayed. This display is intended to fit well on a single terminal screen so that it can be easily "spot checked".

If everything looks OK, one can cd into directory ./postProcess and follow it's README file for more extensive analysis.

Perhaps most importantly, a line like
      ###################### NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TAKEN AS: 240 ######################
at the very end "governs" the subsequent (./postProcess) runs. For example (in ./postProcess) command
      ./trnsfrMtrx_X 240 1
would be appropriate to examine the X transfer matrix at index 1.

Including ./postProcess, three directories are used
      ./sxf2propagator
      ./propagate
      ./postProcess
(see root Makefile). The first two are expected to be pretty static.

An overview of the major files involved is then straightforward, with those in ./postProcess likely of most interest.

The standard bunch strengths are all hard coded at +1.0e-06. This a TBD!

Another probable TBD is the number of processed lattice elements. This is currently the quads and simply split bends, and is 240. Lines like
      ###################### NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TAKEN AS:

                                        240                   <<<<<<<<<<----------

      ###################### NUMBER OF ELEMENTS
should be seen.

In directory
      ./postProcess
make clean, make works. A command like
      ./trnsfrMtrx_X 240 150
gives one turn X transfer matrices. 150 <= 240.

Specific input probes, and bunches of them, are hopefully templatable, however.
