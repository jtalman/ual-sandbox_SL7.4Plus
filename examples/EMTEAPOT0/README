This assumes a fresh "clone" of this code:
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus
      cd ual-sandbox_SL7.4Plus
      setenv UAL `pwd`
      cd $UAL
      source setup-linux-ual
      make clean
      make

This file is in
      $UAL/examples/EMTEAPOT0

A good way to initiate/start proceedings from here is the basic
      make clean
      make

This should pop up plots of some standard particles: the "Standard Bunch". An overview of the major files involved is then straightforward.

The standard bunch strengths are all hard coded at +1.0e-06.

Specific input probes, and bunches of them, can now/then be templated.

Three directories are used
      ./sxf2propagator
      ./propagate
      ./postProcess
(see root Makefile).
