A line like
      ###################### NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TAKEN AS: 240 ######################
should have been seen at the end of the directory
      $UAL/examples/EMTEAPOT0
process:
      make clean
      make

The user should be in this directory
      ./postProcess

Now command
      ./trnsfrMtrx_X 240 1
is be appropriate to examine the X transfer matrix at index 1.

Command
      ./trnsfrMtrx_X 240 240
is be appropriate to examine the X transfer matrix at index 240. Of course it should match the earlier result.

Command
      ./trnsfrMtrices_X 240
outputs
      ./out/beta_iX
It can be examined with
      gnuplot
            gnuplot > l './gnuplot/beta_iX.gnu'
